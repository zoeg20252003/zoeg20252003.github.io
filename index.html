          <h2>Streaming and Socialization</h2>
          <p class="description">
          I am sure you all have heard the Netflix intro. You love that sound. You know that sound. That sound probably reminds you of curling up in your bed on weekends and binge-watching your favorite shows. But when was the last time that sound reminded you of your family? You probably need to think a little hard about that one. Streaming services are booming, outselling box offices and giving people so many reasons to drop their cable subscriptions. With this drive away from leaving the house to watch movies, we should be closer than ever right, but are we really? <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atul-bharadwaj-664093970/cables-to-streaming?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">Stay tuned to learn how to stream more conscientiously!</a>
